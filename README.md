# Deepfake Detection Model 🎭

This project is a Deepfake Detection System built using TensorFlow and Streamlit. It processes individual video frames and uses advanced machine learning models to determine whether a video is **authentic** or **manipulated**.

## 🚀 Features

- Real vs Fake video classification
- Frame-by-frame processing using deep learning
- Simple and interactive web interface (Streamlit)
- Supports large video file uploads (up to 1 GB)
- Utilizes MTCNN for facial detection in frames
